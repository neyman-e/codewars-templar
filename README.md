# Code Wars TEMPLAteRS

We're the Code Wars Knight Templars. We're gonna fight the code wars as the best and most respectful Knight Templars ever, creating a nice parser which dynamically automates the creation of each and everyone of our Codewars kata folders, with the use of our TEMPLAteR swords.

[Just if you don't know what a Knight Templar is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar)


Installation instructions:

To retrieve all required information from the kata-URL, selenium-webdriver is needed, which in turn needs chromedriver.

In order to install selenium-webdriver, just run

`bundle install`

To install the necessary chromium-chromedriver (using apt), run

`sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver`
